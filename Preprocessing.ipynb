      "Dear Vicente, \n",
      " \n",
      "Thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan B. Valdez, a 46-year-old male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing, as well as a history of difficulty in sleep, reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakenings, as well as mixed systemic medical conditions.  \n",
      " \n",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: As you already know, Mr. Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance, as well as increased early morning awakenings, has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties, occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year. He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer. In particular, Mr. Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home.  \n",
      " \n",
      "He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses. He is unaware of a \"restless\" lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep. He denies a history of a \" night owl\" personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties.   \n",
      "He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Mr. Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 11/26/05, during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81/hour, particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas, with equal distribution during non-REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O2 desaturation Nadir of 88% The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas. In addition, loud snoring was noted.  \n",
      " \n",
      "There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88% and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes. There was a predominance of \"light\" non-REM stages I-II sleep, and a concomitant inability to achieve significant \"slow-wave\" or stage REM sleep. There was also \"alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep\" evident during the initial sleep study. In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted.  \n",
      " \n",
      "The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 01/15/06, also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough, during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas (respiratory disturbance index equals 2/hour) with CPAP titrations between 4-6 cm. Sleep efficiency improved to 91%, a short sleep onset latency was also noted (3 minutes). There was once again an increased predominance of \"light\" non-REM stage I-II sleep, with concomitant inability to achieve sustained \"slow wave sleep\".  \n",
      " \n",
      "Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration (at 6 cm of water pressure) and with various CPAP mask modifications (including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt \"Breeze\" supportive head gear with \"nasal pillows\". The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology, relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use, and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general. As a result, he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time, although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Of particular note, and exacerbation of the past year, the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings (averaging 2-4 in number) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9:30 p.m. (the patient describes one awakening at 11:30 p.m. and the second awakening at 11:45 a.m., of unclear causative etiology). The patient then might awaken at 3 a.m. and be \"ready for the day\".  If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter, the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a.m.  \n",
      " \n",
      "The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes, coronary artery disease, depressive disorder, as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition, with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis.  \n",
      " \n",
      "MEDICATIONS:  \n",
      "1. Provigil 200 mg p.o. q. a.m. PRN.  \n",
      "2. Lithium.  \n",
      "3. Valproate.  \n",
      "4. Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d.  \n",
      "5. Humulin 15 units at night.  \n",
      "6. Folate.  \n",
      "7. Metoprolol.  \n",
      "8. Cardia.  \n",
      "9. Vitamin E.  \n",
      "10. Coated aspirin.  \n",
      " \n",
      "ALLERGIES/ADVERSE REACTIONS: The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage.   \n",
      "SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage. He has lost 15-20 pounds over the past several years. His current weight is 195 pounds. He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise, but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time.  \n",
      " \n",
      "On examination, the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 146/88, (seated, left arm), respiratory rate 16.  \n",
      " \n",
      "HEENT EXAMINATION: Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture, with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted.  \n",
      " \n",
      "The patient appears awake, alert, with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact. He is presently wearing dental braces. No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated. No focal, sensory, motor or neurologic deficits are noted. No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.  No current clinical ictal manifestations are present. No acute evidence of \"micro-sleeps\" are noted.  \n",
      " \n",
      "IMPRESSION:  \n",
      "1. Sleep stage/arrousal dysfunction (780.56): Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia, and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of \"lightened\" sleep pattern, with increased predominance of non-REM stages 1-2 sleep, and with the presence of \"alpha\" intrusions and \"alpha delta\" component to deeper sleep. These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep, as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints, depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used (but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage).  \n",
      "2. Sleep disordered breathing: As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations, mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea. The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy, particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it's usage, despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures (6 cm). In addition, he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask, including the Mallinckrodt \"Breeze\" supportive head gear with \"nasal pillows\" and with limited success. One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future, and if so, utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration, which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms, but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to \"tangled tubing at night\" and issues referable to nasal face mask usage, as noted above.  3. Relative difficulties in sleep reinitiation and maintenance:  The patient describes at least 2-4 early morning awakenings with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance, thereby compounding his current sleep problem. While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year, there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation; i.e. in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousals or limb associated arousals or periodic limb movements of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit.  \n",
      " \n",
      "PLAN:  \n",
      "1. In the short course, in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired, and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife, I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy, 5 mg tablets, utilizing one to two tablets p.o.  q. h.s. PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance.  \n",
      "2. The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2-3 times per week, in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency.  \n",
      "3. The patient was advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effects of Zolpidem tartrate therapy including  hypersomnolence, gastric upset, loose stools, diarrhea, and or cardiac palpitations.  \n",
      "Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy, I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy (in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms). If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however, I might consider supplemental O2 therapy at night and, with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end-tidal CO2 monitoring as well.  \n",
      "4. In the meantime, the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim.  \n",
      "5. The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy, but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation (in approximately four months time).   \n",
      "Once again, thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr. Harlan Valdez. I hope this letter finds you well.  \n",

This CP was minimal, but the weakness made him pull over.  He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission.  His EKG c/w 2/2107 showed flattened T-wave in V2 and TWI in V3 and flattened T-waves in I, aVL. His trop was negative, but MB index was elevated.  Due to T-wave flattening, history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab.  \n",

A first no-eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2cd stent was placed.  On admission to CCU, pt still in AF with RVR (120's).

He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.  I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left.  The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses.  \n",

It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday. She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV. She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress. ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection. Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16. \n",

Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012. Her Temp. was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission. She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K. Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP. Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr. When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin. The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.\n",

He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years. He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain. He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain. Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable. He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate. \n",

I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression. He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression. I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered. A surgical consent was obtained. The plan is to perform the surgery on 08/31/2135. Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy. \n",

He was started on albuterol and advair with no improvement. On 08/30/2135, he experienced worsening exertional shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. He sought medical attention at Natchaug Hospital ED. An initial ECG revealed Q waves in V1-V4. He ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin on 2.0. He was found to be in congestive heart failure. He was given plavix, aspirin, lovenox and IV lasix with improvement in symptoms. \n",
      "On 08/31/2135, he was transferred to Gibson Community Hospital for cardiac catheterization. The results were significant for multivessel coronary artery disease and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30%. He was referred to Dr. Sebastian Dang for elective cardiac surgical revascularization and possible mitral valve repair. He was discharged to home on 09/02/2135. \n",
      "On 09/03/2135, he developed recurrent left sided chest pressure while at rest. He took 2 SL TNG with improvement in symptoms. He presented to Gibson Community Hospital ED. He was started on IV heparin. Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative. He was found to have an elevated BNP to 2817. A CXR showed congestive heart failure. He was admitted to CAU. He had an episode of chest pressure while at rest that resolved with 1 SL TNG. He is being referred for consideration of cardiac surgery. \n",

      "   72 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, and CAD. He sufferred a NSTEMI on 8/30/35. A cath at that time revealed an occluded mid LAD lesion, a 75% ostial OM2 stenosis, a 90% OM4 stenosis, and a non-dominant RCA with a 90% stenosis. His LVEF was estimated at 25-30% with moderate MR. He was discharged home on 9/02/35 to orbit for future CABG. \n",
      "9/03/35 He was admitted to Natchaug Hospital secondary to recurrent rest pain. n 9/04/35 Echo revealing moderate MR with no other significant valvular abnormalities. There was segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving the septal, apical, inferior, and anterior territories. EF 55%.  There was segmental right ventricular dysfunction involving the apex. The plan was for this patient to undergo CABG; however the patients wife was involved in a serious MVA, and with further discussion the decision was made to take him to the cath lab to attempt PCI so that the patient could be with his wife as soon as possible. \n",
      "9/05/35 He was taken to the CCL. mid LAD had a 100% occlusion after the D1. The D1 was a small vessel with an ostial, eccentric, 90% lesion. The OM2 had a 60% eccentric lesion that did not appear flow limiting. The LPDA had a 95% complex lesion in the proximal third. He underwent stenting of the native mid LAD with a  Xience OTW 2.5 X 23mm stent with an excellent result. This was followed by kissing-balloon angioplasty of the ostium of the 1st diagonal and the LAD. The pre-intervention stenosis was 90% with 0% residual stenosis. Finally, stenting of the proximal third of the left PDA was performed using a Xience V 2.5 x 15mm and a 2.5 x 12mm stent. The pre-intervention stenosis was 95% with 0% residual stenosis. At the end of the case, there was TIMI III flow throughout with no perforation or dissection. The patient remained stable throughout the rest of the admission with no further chest discomfort. He was discharged home on 9/06/35. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since his discharge he has noticed that he was dyspneic with lying flat. He has also noticed some exertional fatigue and dyspnea. He presented to Natchaug Hospital for further evaluation.  His ECG showed no acute changes, CXR consistent with mild CHF.  He has been aggressively diuresed with improvement  in his level of dyspnea. He was transferred to GCH for a repeat cardiac catheterization. \n",

No fevers, chills, other GI symptoms or exposure for infectious colitis.

      "  Thank you very much for your referral of Gabrielle Oreilly for evaluation of coronary artery disease and a right coronary artery aneurysm as documented on CT scanning.  She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago. She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD. She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine. She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler. With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered.  She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time. These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week. She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes. \n",

This was performed on 05/20/2101 and did not show any evidence of PE, however, there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery. There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery. She was then referred to me for further evaluation.\n",

      "   Gabrielle Oreilly has multiple risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a positive family history, and heavy tobacco use in the past. She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy. Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm. I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan. She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.\n",

      "87yo M with h/o Alzheimer   s vs vascular dementia, vasculopathic (carotid stenosis s/p CEA, PVD) who presents with two weeks of increasing lethargy, disorientation, gait instability and visual hallucinations.  The etiology of this downturn remains unclear.  Given his normal temperature, normal CXR and normal U/A, an infectious etiology is unlikely.  Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results.  However, microembolic disease may be a possibility.  Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer   s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer   s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted.  As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely. LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH.  One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient.  Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation, especially in the elderly. However, it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker, as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning.\n",

      "Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.  He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.  His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.  He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.  He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.  Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.  He is slowly recovering his overall strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d., p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.\n",

      "Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.  The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.\n",
      "\n",
      "Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.  An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.  No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.  I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.  I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.  At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.  In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.  In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.  I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.  He will have routine blood studies obtained today.  I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.  Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.\n",

      "Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.\n",

As you know, her course was complicated by heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and she has been continued on Coumadin anticoagulation.  She has done relatively well in five weeks since surgery and her energy level has improved.  The major ongoing symptoms is aching in the upper part of the sternum, and an opening in the lower part of the incision which drains some purulent material.  She also has a suture and her leg which has worked its way to the surface and causes some discomfort.  Her breathing is much better than preoperatively, and she has had no chest pain.  She has very mild residual dyspnea.  She has had mild edema at times, but it has largely resolved.  She has had no fever.\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old patient with a history of diabetes diagnosed more than 20 years ago.  He has known complication of retinopathy and is status post bilateral laser surgery about one year ago.  He has no known neuropathy or nephropathy.  He has no known history of CAD, CVA or PVD.  He had previously been followed by Dr. Elizabeth Keys at Pioneer Hospital at Findlay until June of this year which time he switched to a new primary care doctor.  At that time, he had been on glyburide, metformin and Avandia, his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia.  He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient. Over the next weeks to months, the patient had progressive peripheral edema, fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of 60 mg orally on this.  He self adjusted his Avandia dose from 4 mg twice daily to 2 mg daily.  His prebreakfast blood glucose has been elevated ranging from 160-200.  He has had some resolution of his fluid overload with the Lasix and lower dose Avandia.  He says he has persistent feeling of swelling and tightness in his fingers and toes with episodic ankle swelling as well.  He denies chest pain, claudication polyuria, polydipsia.  He has been losing weight since starting Lasix.  He has never had hypoglycemia.\n",

He has had inadequate glycemic control on oral agents which are currently at their maximal doses given the intolerable side effects of Avandia.  He has plans for elective knee replacement during the spring and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control, should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation, especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on Avandia.\n",

He will continue his glyburide 10 mg each morning, continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily and Avandia 2 mg each morning.  We will check hemoglobin A1c today as a baseline. We will follow up to determine appropriate titration of his insulin as well as addition of other doses during the day.\n",

      "Dear Dr. Yuan:\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw your patient, Bill Fair, in the Cardiology Office today for evaluation of his coronary artery disease in anticipation of knee replacement on March 23, 2085, and thank you for having him come here for evaluation.  I will be sending a copy of this letter to\n",
      "Dr. Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fair is a 61-year-old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations.  He has had diabetes mellitus for about 20 years.  About two months ago, he started on insulin, and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group.  His most recent glucose had been in the range of 86 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 157, triglycerides 103, HDL of 42, and LDL of 94.  His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 10 units in the morning, 25 units in the afternoon, glyburide 20 mg q.d., and metformin 1000 mg q.d..  He also takes Lasix 60 mg per day, lisinopril 40 mg per day, and Lipitor 10 mg q.d.\n",
      "\n",
      "His other risk factors are notable for hypertension, which has been labile and borderline high in the past.  He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure.  He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor.  He does not smoke cigarettes, but he is obese.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has no known history of MI, angina, or shortness of breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "His other risk is notable for his family history, which includes his father who died at the age of 72 of an MI as well as leukemia.  His mother died at the age of 74 of mesothelioma, and he has two sisters and one brother who are well.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had an echo performed on February 2, 2085, in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2085, and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH.  Overall LV function is mildly-to-moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 40%.  The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar.  The apical anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar.  The right ventricle was normal in size and function, the left atrium was mildly dilated, the aortic valve was unremarkable, the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "His past medical history is notable for kidney stones, which he has had over the past 10 years or so.  He has had three or four attacks, the most recent one was two years ago.\n",
      "He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees.  Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently.  He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr. Oates on March 23, 2085.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "On exam, he is obese but comfortable.  Blood pressure is 150/80, heart rate of 67 and regular, and weight of 278 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  The abdomen is obese.  Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R-wave progression, V1 through V3.  He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI.  The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction.  This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr. Fair to hear this information.  We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion.  In addition, I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible.  He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so.  I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management, since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone.  We will check his Chem-25 today as well as CRP, and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available.\n",
      "I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results.\n",
      "If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.\n",

      "I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Fair at OMC 03/20-21/05.  He is a 61-year-old man with CAD, DM, high cholesterol, HTN, and family history of early CAD, who had a stress test that showed peri-infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA.  Angiography showed a codominant system, a 100 percent left circumflex occlusion, an 85 percent RC lesion, and nonobstructive LAD lesions.  The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2.5mm by 32mm stent was placed.  The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually.  There were no complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications, ambulating without difficulty.  His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma.  Extremities were warm with 1+ edema to the ankles; pulses were 2+ throughout.  Morning labs included cholesterol of 114, triglycerides 109, HDL 34 and LDL 58.  He was discharged home on NPH insulin; Mucomyst, 600mg bid; aspirin, 325mg qd; atenolol, 25mg qd; Lasix, 60mg qd; glyburide, 10mg qd; lisinopril, 40mg qd; Lipitor, 40mg qd; Diovan, 80mg qd; Plavix, 75mg qd; metformin, 500mg bid to be restarted on 03/23/85; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you.  His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis, you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan.  He will see you in follow-up in the next two weeks.  Thank you for allowing us to share in his care.  Please call if you have questions.\n",

      "\tMr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of Insulin-requiring DM, HTN, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C presents with a chief complaint of acute onset shortness of breath. He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch, which he had for three years at 75mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis. He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication. His PCP instructed him to taper the medication, switching him to a 50 mg patch, but Mr. Kaufman removed the patch without a taper. \n",

      "He felt fine for a few days, but began to experience pain in his feet, LE edema, insomnia and rhinorrhea.  On the day of admission, he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness. He described the chest tightness as    like someone sitting on    his R chest below his shoulder, with a band-like distribution across his upper chest, intermittent, non-radiating and somewhat relieved by moving his R shoulder.  This pain lasted 4-5 minutes but his shortness of breath persisted. The shortness of breath was worse with exertion, not improved with rest and caused his to take rapid shallow breaths. He also began to have a non-productive cough this same day. This was the first time he has ever experienced this chest discomfort and shortness of breath. He denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, acid reflux sensation, PND, orthopnea, fever or sick contacts.\n",

      "\tIn summary, Mr. Kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of insulin-requiring DM, hypertension, chronic renal failure and Hepatitis C who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal. His initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. He has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on CXR suggestive of interstitial edema. However, his JVP was not elevated and he only presented with mild LE edema.  His symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. His acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including CHF, drug toxicity (lisinopril and NSAIDs), DM-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.\n",

He then saw his ophthalmologist at the Shenandoah Hospital in Parchman who concluded that this is not due to macular degeneration.  He denies having headaches or any other symptoms at that time.  He denies similar episodes of &#8220;floaties&#8221; in the past and he has no Hx of headaches, disarthria, motor deficits, sensory loss and has never been hospitalized with a stroke or TIA.  He recalls having &#8220;high kidney function&#8221; in the past, but does not recall details.  His PCP arranged for an U/S evaluation, which was done on 8/05/81 and showed 80-85% stenosis of the L proximal ICA.

The CT scan r/o PE and may be consistent w/ failure, but not clear. More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI. Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT. Last ETT in 2085 but was normal at a very low level of exertion. Finally, could this be a primary pulmonary process? If her 02 sat of 78% in the ED is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative. Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles. Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms. Continue current regimen w/ holding Avandia and metformin.\n",

      "HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time. Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074. Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG. In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal. She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD. She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.  Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position. She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea. She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain. Lower extremity swelling continues to be a problem and she is complaining of left heel pain.\n",

      "Just a note for the records regarding Ms. Xanders's recent admission to our Cardiology Service between 08/09/2087 and 08/12/2087.  As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083. She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation.  She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal.  An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads.  Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization.  Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coronary angiography on 08/11/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory.  There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.  After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully.  She tolerated the procedure well,  was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained \"stable\" in the mid 20s.  She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "She understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy,  preferably for more than one year.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care.  A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.\n",

Cholesterol is not perfect, but acceptable.  He is on a high dose of atorvastatin.

She says the pain migrated to involve all of the joints in her hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders and knees. She noticed swelling in her R knee, no swelling or redness in other joints. Her muscles are diffusely tender. She recalls similar muscle discomfort in prior episodes attributed to fibromyalgia, although not as severe. She also remembers shoulder and elbow pain of similar but less intense character in 2128 while taking rifampin/cipro/azithro for MAC. These symptoms resolved when drugs were stopped. She denies recent fevers or chills. She completed an 8 day course of augmentin for MSSA PNA two days ago. Symptomatically she feels her PNA has resolved and she is at her baseline from a respiratory standpoint w/stable cough and SOB. She does report some mild L-sided pleuritic CP since yesterday.

She has no known cardiac hx but does have HTN and + fam hx of early CAD.  Pt awoke this morning in her USOH but quickly had sudden onset of 10/10 sharp SSCP radiating to her right arm associated w/ right arm numbness.  Pain is slightly better w/ sitting up though pt denies pleuritic quality.  She then had a vasovagal attack, which she has had before in the setting of pain, and she started to feel lightheaded, nauseated, and diaphoretic.  She laid down on the floor and elevated her legs above her head which helped a little.  Her husband gave her Excedrin w/o improvement and called 911.  EMS gave her 3 puffs of NTG and 4 baby ASA w/o effect.  The ambulance brought her to the closest hospital, Colorow.  In the ED, she was found to be hypertensive w/ SBP 180s, for which she was started on TNG gtt.  She also underwent PE CT which per report was neg for PE but showed bilat DVTs, and she was started on heparin.  She was given fioricet, zofran, and fentanyl for her CP w/ relief.  She was then given a dose of IV lopressor and also had one episode of N/V.  Her labs were significant for + cardiac markers: 1st set w/ CK/MB/index 39/0.9/2.3, trop I 0.03, 2nd 443/57.3/12.9, trop 2.22, 3rd set 686/87.3/12.7, trop 4.18.  EKGs showed right-bundle morphology (though QRS not wide) w/ initial TWI V1-V3 which progressed to deepening TWI V1-V4 and some downsloping STD V3-V4.

There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration, other than that associated with GE reflux, to explain his lung disease.  He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon, although this likely would necessitate low-dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes.\n",

      "   Mr. Horn is a 60 y.o. male w/ h/o idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis s/p single right lung transplant in April 2094 whose post-op course has been complicated by CMV viremia, valcyte-induced myelosuppression and severe deconditioning.  Mr. Horn was most recently admitted from 12/11/94 through 12/30/94 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea, although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection. His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w/ very minimal activity.  Additionally, he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss. \n",
      "\n",
      "During that admission, he was transfused to a Hct&gt;30 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline.  His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake. Nutrition was consulted, a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition. He was discharged without incident on 12/30.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient continued w/ Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months. He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia (7 cells) on 1/29/95.  Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 450 QOD, and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations. He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 300 mcg sc qd on 2/14/95 for a WBC of 0.6. At that time is HCT was 24.8 and PLTs 32K.  \n",

That day she suffered a mechanical fall, slipping on a blanket in her home.  She hit her left eye, but denies LOC.  The next day, she was    achy    all over, noted a dry cough, and was    wheezy.     The day prior to admission, she states that she    couldn't breath    and had to come into the ER.\n",

      "On arrival to WGH at 11:30AM 01/18/88 vitals were: P 93  BP 121/82  RR 22  96% on room air.  She had a prolonged ER course of 31 hours duration.  Initially, she was treated for presumed COPD flare with nebulizers, prednisone and doxycycline.  A rapid flu test was positive for influenza A.  She received 1 liter of normal saline.  Approximately 6 hours later, she complained of 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, non-radiating.  EKG showed: sinus tachycardia @115bpm, with STE 1mm AVR, and STD II, V3-V5.  Her pain came to 1/10 with 2L NTG and Ativan.  Small doses of IV lopressor were given.  STDs partially resolved.  Around 10AM the day of admission  (01/19/88) her blood pressure acutely rose to 190 systolics, her heart rate increased to 106bpm.  Per the patient, she remembers having a coughing fit, and being unable to catch her breath.  She was placed on CPAP, then switched to BiPAP for ABG: 125/78/7.13.  She was felt clinically to be in flash pulmonary edema.  She was treated with nebulizers, intravenous TNG, lasix and BiPAP.  With improvement in hemodynamics, her pain and shortness of breath improved.  Enzymes were drawn and showed: trop 0.22, CK 122, MB 11.7.  She was started on heparin, integrillin (though unclear if she received it).\n",

Pt reports she has had a bladder infection off and on for the past several months manifesting as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria. Went to WGH Pecos clinic 1 wk pta and received fosfamycin. Went back on Tue w no resolution of sx and says med was changed (? to nitrofurantoin per ED pass-off). On Friday AM, woke up with sob. Felt bloated in her stomach and had difficulty w breathing when trying to get dressed. Sob much worse w activity, would resolve w lying down, associated w diaphoresis. Pt denies CP at the time of the episode (reports some subsequent short-lived R-sided CP in WGH ED, similar to R-sided CP she has had    off and on for awhile    wh she did not mention to the ED staff). Denies palpitations, arm or jaw pain. Denies increase in LE edema, no recent change in meds, excellent medication regimen compliance, not a lot of salt in diet, and no recent diet changes. Pt does sleep on mult pillows but says she does this because of her reflux disease. Pt does think she had similar sob 1-2  yrs ago when she was admitted to WGH, told she had CHF, and was diuresed. Because of her symptoms on Friday 12/09/88, pt went into WGH Pecos clinic. Per Pecos note, EKG at that time showed ST depressions in I,aVL, V5, V6, II/III/aVF. Pt received ASA 325 and lasix 40 mg IV, and was sent to WGH ED.\n",

      "History of Present Illness: 74 yo M who comes to the office in search of a second opinion about his care at the Boaz Nursing Home in Lynden. He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2059 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH. Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT. Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him. He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week, however, is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done.\n",

I have reassured him of this, and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future. I also informed him that he will likely need anti-androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA. He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future.\n",

      "Mr. Quin's oncological history begain in 2061 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (unknown gleason, PSA).  He underwent radical prostatectomy in 2061 and salvage XRT in 2062.  His care was at BNH and we don't have his XRT records.  The patient recalls 37 treatments.   The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3.52 in 10/75.  He underwent a bone scan in 11/75 showing worrisome uptake at L5. In 1/76 he had a PSA of 17.46.  He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control.  His course was complicated by a possible bladder/urethral infection.  He is incontinent from his surgery.  In 2/76 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder (TCC vs. prostatic scar/inflammation).  \n",
      "The patient's LLP worsened.   He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance.  On the day of presentation, he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed.  The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room. Just before arrival to the ED he developed stridor, in his words he was    sucking air in and out.     ENT was consulted in the ED and determined that he had a limited glottic gap, and that the acute stridor was most likely secondary to anxiety and increased air flow through a restricted glottic opening, recommending humidified air by shovel air mask, steroids, and outpatient followup.  MRI of the lumbar spine showed metastatic disease involving of the L4 vertebral body, extending into the pedicles, both L4-5 neural foramina, and the prevertebral soft tissues.  No compression of the thecal sac.\n",

We then discussed the treatment options.  Mr. Quin would like to undergo a course of palliative radiotherapy to relieve his pain.  We will simulate (plan) the patient's XRT tomorrow am, with a treatment to follow on the same day.  All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction.  We would also recommend an GU oncology consultation regarding the patient's ADT and other possible systemic therapies.

Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in the BNH system, and disease extended beyond the prostate to the margins of the resection and into the seminal vesicle. In early 2062 he received adjuvant radiation. His PSA remained undetectable throughout the 2060s, but was troubled by a great deal of radiation cystitis with hematuria, frequency, and dysuria. In addition, he was totally incontinent. In 2071 his PSA was undetectably low.   \n",

      "Over the last 8 months, he has developed low back pain of progressively increasing severity. His PSA back in September 2075 was approximately 3 and when checked in November was 17. Early this year his pain was of great severity, and repeat CT scans and bone scans were performed. Destructive disease was seen in the body of L4 with foraminal encroachment. The thecal sac and the cauda quina were, however, intact. He was started in early February on bicalutamide and was scheduled to have a Zoladex injection, but his pain became more and more severe, and ultimately he was admitted to the LMH last week where I first met him. Since admission he was started on urgent radiotherapy and has completed 12 cycles of radation with a last PSA of 1.7.

Since he is asymptomatic, I would continue medical therapy.  For some reason, he has not started Lipitor.  His LDL is markedly elevated.  My target LDL would be below 70.  For his myocardial protection, I have suggested that he increase the dose of Toprol from 25 mg. qd to 50 mg. qd.\n",

He has been dependent on a SP tube for bladder drainage, however, after the past 2 SP tube changes, he has developed urosepsis. He now presents again in urosepsis after his most recent SP tube change. He also complains of bilateral pelvic/hip pain which is limiting his ability to walk without a walker.

She had been on Tamoxifen 10 mg. b.i.d. for 5 years, but this was d/c'd in March 2086 by Dr. Quy Cherry and she has had not sign of recurrence. She does, however, have a great deal of anxiety about the return of her malignancy and when her daughter found a \"lump\" in her back last week in the course of giving her a massage, she became convinced that her cancer had returned.O:  Well-healed L modified radical mastectomy.  No axillary notes noted.  R breast appears normal.  Pt. gets routine mammograms on the R breast. No lumps or masses were found in or on her back.

She always has edema in both legs, except when she arises in the a.m. at which time her legs are free of edema.  At the same time, she denies PND and says that she sleeps on only one pillow. She denies chest pain, says that she eats well and has regular BMs.  Her biggest complaint now is urinary pressure and urgency.  She had been using a Pessary for Uterine decensus, but it was removed by Gyn and she was prescribed local Estrogen cream, which has not yet helped.  She was advised to call Gyn for another visit, since she was scheduled about 6 weeks from now.\n",

Patient did quite well and was discharged to her daughter's home approximately 1 week after her surgery.

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 55 yr old male with cardiac risk factors of Hypertension, Type II DM, +FH, low HDL, and obesity who was in his USOH until yesterday morning when he developed 3/10 pain across his anterior chest while at rest that he describes as burning in quality with radiation into both jaws and through to his back.  The pain subsided without intervention after about 30 minutes.  He remained pain free until this morning when around 6:45 am, he again experienced this burning sensation in the same distribution.  He also felt nauseated and diaphoretic.  On the way to the hospital, the pain subsided.  He was pain free upon presentation to the ER, but developed chest pain briefly while in triage that had again disappeared by the time he was evaluated in Trauma.  He denies any SOB, fever, chills, or cough.  There was no positional component to his pain nor could he identify any relieving or exacerbating factors. \n",

Patient woke up on 1/16/05 with intermittent, stuttering \"pressure-like\" substernal chest pain, rating 7 out of 10, lasting from 15 minutes to 45 minutes.  He is very active with walking exercises, and gardening, and had not experienced this type of pain before.  The pain radiated down the left arm, his left jaw, and shoulder, as well as, causing \"throat tightness\".  He denied associated SOB, DOE, diaphoresis, palpitations, fevers, chills, N/V/D, or any other constitutional symptoms.  He took an ASA 81mg PO x1, called his PCP, and presented to MSH.\n",

The chest pain resolved, and the pt has been chest pain free since.  6 hours after presentation he had 7 beat run of VT. He has not had anymore chest pain since the ER but did have palpitations with VT run. He feels his heart being 'irregular' at times.

      "Dr. Fredrick Debra is a 59 yo with CAD, HTN, and DM2 who presents with three days of chest discomfort and hypertension.  His symptoms started on Tuesday afternoon, three days ago, while working in the yard.  He describes substernal chest pressure that waxes and wanes in intensity, but has been constant since its onset.  It does not radiate.  It was associated with &#8220;gurgling&#8221; like &#8220;loose phlegm&#8221; in his chest at its onset, but this has since resolved.  It was worse while sitting in the car or leaning forward or backward, but not with twisting.  He has not had any recent URI symptoms.  Tylenol helps take the edge off of his discomfort.  He has been measuring his BP at home, and over the past few days it has ranged to 190/102 averaging 170/80.  He reports compliance with his medications without recent changes.  He has had worsened dyspnea on exertion, stating that he could walk 1+ miles one week ago, but could only manage 1/4 mile today.  He sleeps on two pillows with no changes, and he denies LE edema.  His anginal equivalent includes jaw and neck pain and mild substernal chest pressure without radiation to his arms; he states his current symptoms are not consistent with his angina.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He called Dr. Upham, his cardiologist, and was told to increase his Lasix frequence to 20 mg BID.  He was encouraged to come to the SSH ED for his symptoms given his history of CAD (below).  On arrival, the vital signs were T 96.7, P 71, BP 166/81, RR 18, Sat 97% RA.  He had negative kiosk biomarkers and no EKG changes.  He received NTG x3 without much relief and ASA at home.  \n",

      "     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as \n",

      "     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.  \n",

      "HPI:\n",
      "Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type II, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to HTN and DM, Mr. Eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of CAD (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147.  He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG, exercise tolerance test, and Myoview study.  Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC   s in recovery.  The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.  On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.  Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.  A subsequent exercise echo was normal.  Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.  His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.  Hemoglobin A1C in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.   He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.  These episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.  The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.  His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.  He was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.  Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.  The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.  The patient denies recent or past history of edema, GERD, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2L O2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.  EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.  Subsequent EKG   s revealed continued PVC   s and PAC   s with biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  A chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.  CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.  Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but D-dimer was elevated at 816.  Stool sample was guiac positive, although CBC was stable with HCT 44.6.  \n",

      "Assessment:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Eubanks is a 68 year-old man with HTN, DM II, and gout, who presents with 2 hours of severe chest pain.  The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.  The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE.  The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.  The patient   s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.  In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.  The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.  Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.  This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.  \n",
      "EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation, although T-wave inversions were present in some leads.   The patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ED x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.  The patient may have either a non-ST elevation MI or unstable angina.  The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.  Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.  \n",

      "Intern Addendum: I have interviewed and examined the pt with the medical student. In brief, the pt is a 67M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms. He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N, V, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time. The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin. Upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week. He has not had any DOE, PND, or LE edema. He does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in Feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the Pennsylvania Hospital. He does not know the details of the workup. Of note the pt does not smoke, is not on ASA, and has several family members with CAD but no men <55 or women<65. He is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose. \n",
      "In the ED, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro. HR was 85 and BP 135/82. He was given ASA and a BB. Initially, his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V4-6. Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped Ts in V4-6. There were no old EKGs available for comparison. He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (Hct 44). A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE. (the ddimer was elevated). His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation. On exam, he was in NAD and was CP free. Heart was RRR, lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema. ASA and BB were cont. The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test. However, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead. This is planned for this morning. Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol. \n",

On the morning of admission, patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back.  Pain persisted for 2 hours, prompting the patient to present to the BBH ED for further care. In the ED, patient was treated with ASA, metoprolol, sl NTG, and chest pain resolved. EKGs showed biphasic T-waves in V4-5.  CT scan was negative for aortic dissection or other acute pathology.  Cardiac markers were negative.  Patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for further management. Of note, at Pennsylvania Hospital, patient had a positive ETTMIBI showing fixed + mild reversible defect in the inferoapical region in 2/47, followed up with normal exercise echo in 5/47.\n",

Because of his risk factors for disease, the decision was made to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization. In the cath lab, patient was found to have multivessel CAD with an LAD culprit.  He received 3xCypher stents to the mid and distal LAD with residual flow limitation.  RCA with moderate disease.  LCx with distal disease.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Ida was seen back today for evaluation of Sjogren's as well as left wrist \n",
      "pain.  Her Sjogren's has been reasonably stable.  She still remains with \n",
      "difficulty in controlling her blood sugar.  She has continued difficulty with \n",
      "her oral cavity.  She has had no extraglandular symptoms -- specifically, \n",
      "polyneuropathy, myopathy, or purpura.\n",
      "\n",
      "She uses artificial tears and saliva.  She remains on insulin and estrogens.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has a one-week history of pain and swelling of her left wrist.  She was \n",
      "seen at the Graduate Hospital Emergency Room several days ago.  Radiographs of the \n",
      "wrist show chondrocalcinosis.  She was started on Motrin with some response \n",
      "but still has active symptoms.  She is wearing a splint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today on exam, she is afebrile.  There was OA involving the DIP joints.  PIPs \n",
      "and MCPs were nontender.  The left wrist showed swelling and heat with \n",
      "diminished motion.  Right wrist showed full range of motion.  Elbows, \n",
      "shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet did not show active synovitis.  \n",
      "There was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique.  No fluid was obtained.  \n",
      "I injected it with 40 mg of Depo-Medrol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinically, I think she has had pseudogout.  She has chondrocalcinosis on \n",
      "radiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease.  In \n",
      "addition, she has primary Sjogren's.  The two diseases are unrelated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to injection of her wrist, I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex \n",
      "200 mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues.  She should probably \n",
      "take that for about five to seven days.  Side effects were reviewed.\n",

      "HPI:  Ms Rivers was in her USOH until the morning of admission, when she went into the city to buy some buttons and pay a bill at ViewSonic.  She noted that she was not feeling well throughout the morning, and she felt as if she may need to eat something.  However, because she did not have her insulin and blood sugar monitoring equipment, she decided not to eat.  She continued to feel poorly (she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled).  She saw a police cruiser, and walked over to it with the intention of getting help.  When she arrived, there was no one in the car, and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car.  This is the last thing she remembered; when she awoke, she was surrounded by people.  She was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head.  When EMS found her, she was confused, making repetitive statements, and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck.  When she arrived at the FMH ED, her blood pressure was 213/97 HR 84 RR20 O2 sat 99% RA Temp 97.3.  She received Labetolol 20 iv, Toradol 30 mg iv, ASA 325 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg po x 1.  Her mental status cleared somewhat, and her blood pressure came down to 130s/80s.  She did have one episode of emesis, during which her HR was noted to transiently dip to the 40s (not captured on the monitor); spontaneously recovered to the 60s.\n",

      "She had a C-spine series and head CT which were negative for acute process, and a CXR which was negative except for R shoulder not well-visualized on CXR.  She was noted to have some superficial bleeding of her posterior scalp, but no obvious laceration.  She was admitted to the SDU because of the episode of bradycardia.\n",

In the ER, the pain was characterized as mechanical, but was also relieved by SLNTG (which however precipitated hypotension, brady to 30s). EKG showed only ? slight exaggeration of baseline 1mm ST elevation in V2, V3.  She was heparinized and admitted to SDU.  R/O by serial markers.  Cardiac cath on the day after admission showed a tight RCA (with unclear relationship to anterior ischemia seen on prior stress).

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.  He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.  If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later.  This is relieved by sitting.  It will happen when walking as well.  This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.  He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.  Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.  \n",

Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.

      "ASSESSMENT:  \n",
      "1.  Neuropathy.  The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.  He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.  He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.  There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.  I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.  I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.  He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.  I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.  \n",

VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe.  Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus.

Over the past two weeks, he can no longer walk more than a block, whereas in the past he could walk &gt; 100 yards (and per his daughter, as far as he wanted).  He states that at night he wakes up short of breath and has to dangle his feet off the side of the bed, when he noticed they were quite swollen.  Additionally, he has trouble lying on his back, and has to either lay on his side or prop himself up, which is new.  He does not report any chest pain, or history of MI.

      "Ms. Iot is a 69-year-old female with a history of CHF (EF 40%, no home O2), DM type 2, HTN, nephrotic syndrome, and 1/8/2075 R humerus ORIF presenting from Crest Nursing Home with SOB and HTN. She was discharged from NGH to rehab on 1/8/2075 after ORIF of a right humeral fracture. She feels that she has been doing fairly at rehab. On the evening prior to admission, however, she had some anxiety that resolved after receiving Ativan from her nurse. She then was able to fall asleep but woke-up at 2AM with diaphoresis and SOB. She denied chest pain. She was attended to and her BP was 220/117. She was given 2 SL NTG, O2, and Lasix, after which her SOB somewhat improved but her HTN continued. She also complains of a chronic cough that is productive of white/yellow sputum. She denies missed medications, changes in diet, adding salt to meals (although she is at rehab and her diet order is unclear). At this time, she denies CP, SOB. \n",

      "Ms. Ito first palpated a left breast lump in 2070. Two years later she was seen by her PCP and referred to surgery. In March '72 a mammogram showed a 1.6 cm left breast mass at 12 o'clock, also evident on ultrasonography. An additional group of indeterminate microcalcifications was noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. \n",
      "On 3/22/72 a biopsy of the left breast mass confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. Stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant calcifications showed only fibrocystic changes. On 5/31/72 she underwent a L lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 2.0 x 2.5 x 2.3cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3,  with negative margins, ER+PR+Her2neu-, sentinel node negative. She was then referred to multidisciplinary clinic and received a recommendation for whole breast irradiation and adjuvant endocrine therapy.\n",

      "HPI: The pt has not had any significant recent CV history.  When pressed, she notes that about 6 months ago, she had an episode of mild chest tightness while at rest which was not particularly severe nor was it exacerbated or relieved by any measures.  These sx occurred only once, and lasted for a \"few hours\" before abating.  She reports that she thought it might be \"heartburn,\" though she is not prone to dyspepsia.  Subsequently, she denies any exertional dyspnea, CP, jaw or arm pain, belching, post-prandial discomfort, \"heartburn\" or palpitations.  She has not had any sx of CHF including pnd, orthopnea or LE edema.  Moreover, she denies claudication (legs or arms).  She reports that she has a \"sedentary\" lifestyle, but still carries groceries, does laundry, and usual housework without limitation.  She presented to her PCP Dr. Ong for an annual physical recently and on ECG, he noted new inferior Q waves and referred her for ETT which she had today.  As noted below, she had an early positive ECG with NO symptoms of angina, but with marked light-headedness with STD and bigeminy lasting up to 20' into recovery.  Scans were notable for EF 51% with inferior HK and an inferior fixed defect and inferolateral ischemia.  She was then transferred to BH ED and here to MMC for angiography.\n",

From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.  I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.  She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).  She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.\n",

      "1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.  NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.  Will discuss with Drs. Harper/Kumar tomorrow.  Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.  She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)\n",
      "2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.  She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.\n",

He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands, which is possibly similar to before or less so.  He also has some posterior neck tingling, probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight.  He has no weakness in any extremities.  His nocturia has decreased from three to one.  His hands feel a little \"fuzzy.\"  The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right.  \n",

Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months.  Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are.  Dr. Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure.  \n",

      "HPI: The patient is a 62 year old male with history of CAD s/p stents of LAD lesion in February 2070 readmit with chest pain.  At the time of this stenting, he had total occlusion of his midRCA and mid circumflex with collaterals.  He presented with recurrent CP in May, and he underwent a second cath that revealed patent LAD with stent.  This admission he had a 10-15 minute episode of chest and jaw pain with tachycardia and hypertension by home monitoring.  The pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins.  He went to Butte Ridge Associates where he was placed on heparin.  In the setting of heparin bolus with PPT >150, he had one episode, moderate volume of painless rectal bleeding.  Since transfer, still on heparin, he had no further bleeding, nor guiac positive stool until today.   This morning he passed a large brown bowel movement which was guiac negative.  Following this, after returning to bed, he had a small amount of oozing of blood from his rectum.  He had no abdominal pain.  No further bleeding since this morning.  He has never had rectal bleeding previously on aspirin and plavix.  His colonoscopy in 2066 revealed diverticulosis.  He is currently on aspirin, plavix, heparin with therapeutic PTT.\n",

He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners, but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited.  There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications.  There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk.

      "The patient had recatheterization in May demonstrating 30% stenosis at the stent on the LAD.  He has diffuse disease, otherwise with good collateralization.  His exercise tolerance test in May showed excellent exercise tolerance, but positive images and positive tracings for ischemia.  His Duke ETT score was -10, but his perfusion images showed moderate reversibility in the inferior myocardium with fixed defect anteriorly.  He had infero-apical hypokinesis with an EF of 45%.  It is also noted that his blood pressure fell, but normalized during exercise.  The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly.  He has no chest squeezing, neck squeezing, or jaw pain, but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth.  He correlates this with exercise, but not consistently.  He also occasionally feels this at rest.  He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 90.  He is working doing heavy labor in the garden, moving, and digging.  It is not clear that this represents angina, but we will let Dr. Null know.  He is seeing Dr. Null in three to four weeks.     01/13/2072: .  The patient has been improving steadily since his last admission for CABG in November 2070.  He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 17 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue.  He has no chest pain or palpitations.

She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.  This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.  She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.  She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.  She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.  She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.  She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.  At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.  She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her carotids are 2+.  Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.  There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.  Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.  There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.  After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.  She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.  She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.\n",

Pt converted to NSR in the field. He was stabilized at Blakely House, then transferred to NAMC. At NAMC, patient had electrocardiac cath, which showed 3vd disease and Dr. Albright   s team was consulted. As pt was encephalopathic s/p arrest, he was transferred to Fremont Medical Center on 02/21/33, where he was rehabilitated and his mental status improved. At FMC, his diuretics were titrated (lasix 20 mg -> 40 mg), and psychiatry weighed in on his posthypoxic encephalopathy.

For his pre-operative work-up, the patient had a stress PET exam on 3/26 that was notable for a medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible. As a result, the patient was referred to Dr. Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3/27. Given the patient's risk factors and positive stress test, the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy. On the evening prior to his catheterization, he had dialysis.\n",

      "\tHe is a 75 year old man who is referred by Dr. Freda Erickson of Mauston for consultation regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas. He apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes as    zingers    6 or 7 weeks ago. Work-up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on. This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein. He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions. A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion. Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma. The mass itself is about 2   cm in diameter.\n",
      "\tHis family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer.\n",
      "\tHe denies smoking, drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week.\n",
      "\tHis past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2131, cholecystectomy in 2131, prostatectomy for cancer in 2142 and resection of a lung cancer in 2143.\n",
      "\tHis current medications include Lipitor 40mg a day, Glyburide 5mg three times a day (he has been taking it for 6     7 years), Lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin.\n",
      "\tHe is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans (the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related).\n",
      "\tHis review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis. He has had some mild recent weight loss. He denies symptoms of heart disease, neurologic disease or respiratory disease. His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\n",
      "\tI think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time. With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion, he should first be treated with chemoradiation. He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery, probably not resection but perhaps intra-operative radiation therapy. I   ve explained this to him, his wife and daughter. After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation, with consideration of subsequent IORT. He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us. This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up. I will also get a CA19-9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation.\n",

      "Dear Dr. Overman: \n",
      "I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Wendell Urquhart, in consultation today. The patient presents complaining of lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation. He develop symptoms gradually three months ago with no history of preceding trauma. The symptoms became progressively worse. The patient has a history of lower back injury 30 years ago in a motor vehicle accident - at that time he was diagnosed with disc rupture. Currently the pain is intermittent and occurs daily. He grades the intensity of the pain as up to 7 to 8 out of 10 on the numerical pain scale. He describes it as sharp shooting sensation in the lower back with radiation all the way down right lower extremity to the foot. The symptoms are worse with standing; better with sitting and lying down. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with coughing or sneezing. The patient any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control. He describes occasional intermittent numbness in the right leg and foot. He denies any weakness. He lost 30 pounds through dieting over the past two months. The pain does not wake the patient up at night. \n",

      "There is limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with flexion limited to 60 degrees, extension limited to 10 degrees. There is no tenderness to palpation over the spinous processes, paraspinal muscles, SI joints or greater trochanteric bursae bilaterally. There is full 5/5 strength in the lower extremities with intact sensation bilaterally.  1+ reflexes in the knees, absent reflexes in the ankles bilaterally. There is downgoing Babinski, no clonus, normal tone in the lower extremities. Straight leg raise test is negative bilaterally. There is no pain with hip internal and external rotation. \n",

      "4. Lumbar spondylosis. \n",
      "RECOMMENDATIONS: \n",
      "1. MRI study of the lumbar spine will be obtained to further evaluate etiology of ongoing symptoms. The patient will discuss with radiologist if MRI study can not be performed due to cardiac stents. \n",
      "2. Upon review of the imaging studies, a lumbar epidural steroid injection would be considered to decrease the inflammatory component of his symptoms and to inhibit peripheral nociceptive transmission. \n",
      "3. The patient was encouraged to remain active and to participate in low-impact aerobic exercises to prevent deconditioning. He was encouraged to continue with weight loss program. \n",
      "4. The therapeutic plan was discussed with the patient. All of his questions were answered. He will be seen in follow-up after imaging study is completed in 1-2 weeks. \n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I had the pleasure of seeing Wendell Urquhart in follow-up today. He underwent right piriformis injection under fluoroscopic guidance on 06/10/2133. The patient reports greater than 50% improvement in his symptoms after the procedure. Currently the pain is intermittent. He describes it as sore sensation in the right buttock. He grades intensity of pain as 2/10 on the numerical pain scale. The symptoms are worse with prolonged walking for more than 2 miles a day and completely alleviated with rest. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with Valsalva maneuver. The patient denies any recent fever or chills, no loss of bowel or bladder control, no numbness, no weakness, no unexplained weight loss. \n",

      "REVIEW OF MEDICAL HISTORY: During today's visit, I have reviewed past medical, social and family history, medication list and allergies. There has been no interval change as compared to the previous visit. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Positive for musculoskeletal complains as described above. No recent fever, no chills, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no loss of bowel or bladder control, no unexplained weight loss. The rest of the systems were reviewed and are negative.\n",

      "PHYSICAL EXAM: The patient is alert and oriented to time, person and place. His mood and affect are stable. He demonstrates good attention and concentration. He ambulates without an assistive device with normal heel strike and toe-off. He is able to stand on heels and toes. He is able to walk heel-to-toe in a straight line with intact balance. There is limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with flexion limited to 80 degrees, extension limited to 20 degrees. There is no tenderness to palpation over piriformis muscles, paraspinal muscles, spinous processes, SI joints, or greater trochanteric bursa bilaterally. There is full 5/5 strength in the lower extremities with intact sensation bilaterally. 1+ reflexes in the knees, absent reflexes in the ankles bilaterally. There is downgoing Babinski, no clonus, normal tone in the lower extremities. Straight leg raise and femoral stretch test are negative bilaterally. There is pain with right hip internal rotation. \n",

His vents are mildly dilated in context of general cerebral atrophy that is not o/w out-of-proportion for his advanced age. Onset of his sx's including bilateral headache described as constant 6-8/10 pressure at posterior vertex w/ occ. radiation foward made worse by lying down for some time (worse in the mornings) and better in the afternoons or after sitting or standing. No blurred vision but mild nausea w/o vomiting. No nuchal rigidity or photo-phonophobia. No f/c/ns/cp/sob/rash/weakness/changes in sensation. Describes very clear psychomotor retardation since first fall including d/w concentraion, memory and word retrieval, and extreme slowness in mental processing (including reading - used to be a speed reader and now reads one word at a time very slowly). He's had some urinary urgency but no incontinencey. Describes his d/w gait as not being able to get his legs to do what he wants them to do despite having good strength. Additionally, feels that he's always losing his balance backwards. No suggestion of meningoencephalitis, stroke or seizure. Had mild bilat tinnitus but no vertigo.

      "History of present illness   This is a 54-year-old white male here complaining persistent cough.  He has had a dry cough for about two months.  He was put on inhalers, but there was no improvement.  The cough is worse at night, but also he has it during the day.  He has no mucus production, no hemoptysis, no shortness of breath, and no wheezing.  He is a nonsmoker.  About a week ago, he was admitted to a local emergency room for chest pain.  He was rushed to Ochiltree General because of ST-T wave abnormalities on his EKG.  In retrospect, he has had these changes for many years, and anyway he had a cardiac catheterization, which showed mild obstruction of some of his coronary systems but no evidence of coronary artery syndrome.  He did have cardiomyopathy with the ejection fraction of 35%.  He was sent home on Toprol XL 50 mg QD, Lipitor 10 mg QD, lisinopril 10 mg, aspirin 325 mg once a day, and Avandia 2 mg once a day.  Since returning home, the patient feels no chest pain or shortness of breath.  No orthopnea or PND.  He still has a dry cough.\n",

      "   The  patient was  transferred to OGH in 3/2067 because of chest pain with positive markers and aaaanterolateral T wave changes.At which time he was diagnosed with possible ETOH myocarditis. His EF was 34%. He underwent cardiac cath which showed that the Left Main and LAD were patent, , a very distal LCX lesion. RCA was dominant and patent. The patient was discharged to home on a program of ace, BB, ASA and instructed to curtail his ETOH use. His EF improved to 66 %. He had repeat nuclear stress testing which showed small anterior infarct/small prior inferior infarct and was negative for ischemia in July 2068..\n",
      "   Since then he has had a stable angina pattern with chest pain brought on when he has to move very heavy objects in his work as a packager . This is usually relieved with one TNG. Most recently, he was seen by his PC Dr. Thomson and treated with Augmentin/Robitussin AC for a URI. He had a productive cough  and some chest discomfort related to coughing. \n",
      "   Most recently, he was brought into police custody for public intoxication. While in his jail cell,\"resting\" he developed the sudden onset on midsternal sharp chest pain accompanied by heavy breathing. There was no radiation to the arms, but he noted bilateral hand numbness. He also had palpitations and sweating and felt nauseated. He received one sl TNG. An ambulance was called and he received 2 TNG sprays. His pain diminished. His BP was 176/100 at the time. He was brought to the Evanston Hospital ER and found to have \"high lateral changes\" on his EKG's. Troponins were slightly elevated at .13- considered a \"gray zone\" for the hospitals range  for MI. The patient was pain free after a dose of Morphine. While in the hospital, he was placed on suicide watch. He has a history of a suicide attempt 3 years ago and has previously had counseling and been on antidepressants. He has a son who is in a vegetative state after an MVA whom he helps care for and this is very stressful. His recent arrest made hiite despondent. At Evanston Hospital, he was started on a beta blocker and Lovenox. He had a suboptimal stress test which was stopped because of SSCP and nausea. He is now transferred to OGH for further evaluation.\n",

      "\tReason for visit:\n",
      "   Mr. Bell is an 81 year old male with recent CABG, now admitted via EW with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\tInterval History:\n",
      "   He has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of CAD dating back to April 2097. At that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion. Following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel CAD. He had an IABP placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "He underwent a 4 vessel CABG by Dr. Troyer. His graft anatomy includes a LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the PDA and PLV and a SVG to the OM branch. He required re-exploration for bleeding. He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with Amiodarone. His IABP was removed a few days post operatively. He developed new anterior ST changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 66% to 19%. \n",
      "\n",
      "He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM, a 30% ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV. The LIMA was patent, but there was no flow into the distal LAD. He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm MiniVision stents. \n",
      "\n",
      "His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function. He also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability. He was followed by Dr. Hardin. His HIT assay was borderline negative. He was also found to have a factor VII deficiency, and was treated with argatroban. Lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a R posterior tibial DVT, and he was discharged on Fopndaparinux. A follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation. He was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20. \n",
      "\n",
      "He was discharged from rehab on June 5th. On June 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the VNA. His systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmHg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his Lasix dose was cut in half. He denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations. He denies any PND, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees. The family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath. His Lasix was increased to 40 mg bid. However, when seen by VNA, his room air saturation was 76%. 911 was called and he was brought to WGCC ED for evaluation. \n",

georgia 72196 re valdez harlan dhn 7672624 date of birth 11092062 current clinic visit date 09142109 dear vicente thank you in advance for allowing me to share in the medical care of mr harlan b valdez a 46yearold male patient with prior polysomnographic evidence of sleep disordered breathing a well a a history of difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance and increased early morning awakening a well a mixed systemic medical condition history of present illness a you already know mr valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulty of sleep reinitiation and maintenance a well a increased early morning awakening ha noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulty occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year he is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 15yearold son and a 10yearold daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duty of a set designer in particular mr valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which ha bee markedly curtailed a he is tending to his family situation closer to home he described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pause he is unaware of a restless lower limb sensory complaint which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep he denies a history of a night owl personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruption or sleep difficulty he denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbance or associated narcoleptic symptom mr valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at holy cross on 112605 during which time he wa noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 81hour particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopnea with equal distribution during nonrem and stage rem sleep and with associated o2 desaturation nadir of 88 the respiratory disturbance were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopnea in addition loud snoring wa noted there wa evidence of a sleep efficiency of 88 and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minute there wa a predominance of light nonrem stage iii sleep and a concomitant inability to achieve significant slowwave or stage rem sleep there wa also alpha intrusion and alpha delta sleep evident during the initial sleep study in addition premature ventricular contraction were noted the patient underwent a cpap titration on 011506 also at the tenacre foundation nursing home in boxborough during which time there wa a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopnea respiratory disturbance index equal 2hour with cpap titration between 46 cm sleep efficiency improved to 91 a short sleep onset latency wa also noted 3 minute there wa once again an increased predominance of light nonrem stage iii sleep with concomitant inability to achieve sustained slow wave sleep since his initial trial of nocturnal cpap titration at 6 cm of water pressure and with various cpap mask modification including cpap nasal face mask and a mallinckrodt breeze supportive head gear with nasal pillow the patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology relative difficulty with sustained nocturnal home cpap use and difficulty with regard to cpap to being and complication by the bulkiness of the cpap machine in general a a result he ha not utilized nocturnal cpap therapy for a period of time although he still maintains the cpap equipment in his house of particular note and exacerbation of the past year the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakening averaging 24 in number with typical awakening occurring approximately two hour after sleep initiation at 930 pm the patient describes one awakening at 1130 pm and the second awakening at 1145 am of unclear causative etiology the patient then might awaken at 3 am and be ready for the day if he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakening after a final awakening at 6 am the patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic condition including diabetes coronary artery disease depressive disorder a well a a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition with no upper gi evidence of gastroparesis medication 1 provigil 200 mg po q am prn 2 lithium 3 valproate 4 glucophage 850 mg tid 5 humulin 15 unit at night 6 folate 7 metoprolol 8 cardia 9 vitamin e 10 coated aspirin allergiesadverse reaction the patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendency in association with prior prozac usage social history the patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage he ha lost 1520 pound over the past several year his current weight is 195 pound he is desirous of losing some additional weight with regard to more regular exercise but his hectic social situation make this somewhat difficult at the present time on examination the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 14688 seated left arm respiratory rate 16 heent examination borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted the patient appears awake alert with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact he is presently wearing dental brace no obvious cranial nerve deficit are appreciated no focal sensory motor or neurologic deficit are noted no significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence the routine gait appears to be normal based without evidence of significant gait dystaxias no current clinical ictal manifestation are present no acute evidence of microsleeps are noted impression 1 sleep stagearrousal dysfunction 78056 manifested by subjective complaint of nonrestorative sleep increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of lightened sleep pattern with increased predominance of nonrem stage 12 sleep and with the presence of alpha intrusion and alpha delta component to deeper sleep these latter eeg finding have been described in association with subjective complaint of nonrestorative sleep a well a clinical setting of chronic pain related complaint depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agent used but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage 2 sleep disordered breathing a evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluation mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea the patient appears largely refractory to a trial of cpap therapy particularly in so far a he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptom in association with it usage despite relatively modest cpap water pressure 6 cm in addition he ha tried various nasal cpap face mask including the mallinckrodt breeze supportive head gear with nasal pillow and with limited success one might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future and if so utilizing a potential trial of bipap titration which may help to improve claustrophobic symptom but the patient will still be left with the issue referable to tangled tubing at night and issue referable to nasal face mask usage a noted above 3 relative difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance the patient describes at least 24 early morning awakening with difficulty in sleep reinitiation and maintenance thereby compounding his current sleep problem while there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbation and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbance for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation ie in particular looking for the presence of increased spontaneous arousal or limb associated arousal or periodic limb movement of sleep may be of a special clinical benefit plan 1 in the short course in so far a the patient describes himself a being exceedingly tired and unable to perform the routine daily task of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife i have suggested initiation of prn zolpidem tartrate therapy 5 mg tablet utilizing one to two tablet po q h prn for difficulty of sleep reinitiation and maintenance 2 the patient is advised to take zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 23 time per week in an effort to avoid any issue of physiologic dependency 3 the patient wa advised against potential adverse behavioral and or systemic side effect of zolpidem tartrate therapy including hypersomnolence gastric upset loose stool diarrhea and or cardiac palpitation pending his clinical response of his zolpidem tartrate therapy i then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issue which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of bipap therapy in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptom if he prof poorly responsive to trial of bipap therapy however i might consider supplemental o2 therapy at night and with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated endtidal co2 monitoring a well 4 in the meantime the patient wa advised to contact the sleep disorder clinic for any acute sleep related concern in the interim 5 the patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approach with regard to sleep reinitiation such a hypnotherapy but i will hold off on these strategy pending follow up sleep disorder clinic evaluation in approximately four month time once again thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of mr harlan valdez i hope this letter find you well sincerely yours yovani

dr lu sent her for a followup ett he did not find the first ett acceptable the second ett wa grossly positive a a result of this i think it is reasonable for u in addition to having her on atenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide put her on ramipril and a nitrate she is having once every two week feeling a slight twinge of pain that she wa having before when she went up step she did have hyperlipidemia we have put her on lipitor which ha provided some control however her hcl is still 36 and ldl 118 which is not an excellent ratio nonetheless her ck ha been within normal limit she also

undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyp three have been removed and he then had a gi bleed this ha been reevaluated and he ha been stable the fourth polyp will need to be removed at a later time at this point his aspirin ha been discontinued for a number of day and the lopid wa also discontinued apparently because of increased liver function test his current medication therefore include lasix 40 mg per day metoprolol 25 mg qd nifedipine xl 30 mg qd he is aware of a belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no exertional or other related symptom he is reasonably active but somewhat limited by his claudication on exam today he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 13070 a heart rate of 65 and regular head and neck were unremarkable chest is clear

tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and more prolonged risk prevention i suggest that we increase it to 50 mg bid i also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an eye on it if it drop too low we can reduce the dose he asked that i see him again in about six month for routine reevaluation and i will be happy to do so if any problem develop in the interim please do not

and normal ua an infectious etiology is unlikely concern for a strokerelated etiology either embolic or lacunar is unlikely given ct and mri result however microembolic disease may be a possibility

systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40 at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate no subsequent echocardiogram ha been performed when he is in sinus rhythm impression and plan mr ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery i suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm i told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 36 month and assuming he wa in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period his amiodarone would then be discontinued at that time i would also discontinue his coumadin in addition at the time of his diagnostic catheterization he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease and he understands that when he ha completed his recovery from his recent surgery i would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention in addition i have asked him to obtain copy of his discharge summary from the gadsden medical center i would like to resume ace inhibitor therapy in light of his significant cad and probable left ventricular dysfunction he will have routine blood study obtained today i would target his ldl cholesterol to the 70 range beyond this i have not altered his current regimen thank you very much for allowing me to

15345 41284 page 3 the fact that he is posttransplant ha several risk factor for osteoporosis including prednisone use and a family history of osteoporosis the total amount of exposure to prednisone sound like it is about a yearandahalf or so with half a year during his chemotherapy 14 year ago and then about a year since his transplant the patient history of never having had fracture no bone pain no height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant patient however getting a bone density study in the patient like this make sense we will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on his follow up visit since he cannot have one today for scheduling reason we will also check vitamin d level given patient history of renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to do for him is to give him vitamin d his calcium intake wa estimated to be about 1000 mg a day including one cup of milk green leafy vegetable and one cup of ice cream each day we would be a little reticent about starting higher dos of calcium given his renal failure without more information about this patient the patient diabetes seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugar under fairly good control sounding like they are in the 130 range although we dont have access to hemoglobin a1c given the fact that it sound like he ha got pretty good care by dr paz we will not pursue this at the current time unless asked and we will focus primarily on the bone situation

mainly related to sport injury he ha had in particular 2 year of pain now in his right knee it got so bad 6 month ago that he required large amount of ibuprofen to relieve that it ha slowly got better since then at present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with activity but he also ha rest and night pain he ha a restricted walking distance with regard to function he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and requires period of rest in the evening on returning home from work he ha noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed with regard to treatment he ha is

left knee is currently asymptomatic we have discussed the operative option for him which consist of high tibial osteotomy a unicompartmental knee replacement and a total knee replacement at present neither he not dr oates feel that his symptom are severe enough to warrant operative intervention we would certainly reconsider should he run into trouble in the next few month aspirating his knee instilling some corticosteroid we have advised him that this will only provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight we have organized to see him again in 46 month time at which stage we will reassess him should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly ring up and make an appointment to come and see u and we will aspirate the knee and instill some corticosteroid with kind regard yours sincerely _______________________________ oliver m oates md dd 072880 dt 073180 dv 072880 dictated by xavier

the inferior mi the qrs is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay mr fair clearly ha evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction this had been entirely asymptomatic and wa quite a shock for mr fair to hear this information we will obtain an adenosine mibi scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion in addition i strongly encouraged him to lose a much weight a possible he seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so i think the most important thing is going to be dietary management since i doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calorie to lose weight on that basis alone we will check his chem25 today a well a crp and i will review these result with him a soon a they are available i also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the result if any problem develop in the interim please do not hesitate to contact me we will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week thank you for allowing me to help with his care kindest personal regard ______________________________ liam mcmahon md dictated by liam mcmahon escription document68059879 sffocus cc oliver

to her immunosuppressive drug negative upper and lower endoscopy and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus at the time of admission the hematocrit remained in the low 20 and she wa transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization appropriate bicarbonate and mucomyst therapy were administered and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the

colectomy since january 2095 initially this wa due to concern about possible transfusion need during surgery after extensive conversation with dr orth and with her family and with the patient i believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and perioperative healing far outweigh any potential benefit that she may have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not to pursue this chest pain the patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defect she will continue to be treated with

range my review of ct scan of the chest show faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodule impression 1 interstitial lung disease mild objective impairment by functional status pulmonary function test overall these were stable and the ct scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis however a i reviewed with the patient and his wife it is well established that 10 of the time another disorder such a occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy there is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration other than that associated with ge reflux to explain his lung disease he would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon although this likely would necessitate lowdose steroid the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes 2 ge reflux this is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis if he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle he can have very good control of this 3 possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis 4 possible sleep disorder currently is entirely without symptom now that his reflux is well controlled 5 chronic cough 6 diabetes better controlled 7 obesity he continues to need aggressive weight loss program a i mentioned to him he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such a weight but he is starting to make some progress recommendation 1 continue

meeting particularly with an eye to agent that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia i continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the lowbenefit regiment of prednisone with an immunosuppressant agent i think he may be a very good candidate for gammainterferon but unfortunately not every one benefit from this i emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux if the disease wa indeed progressing we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup the most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity i calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lb to get to a bmi of 30 and that by the time of listing he needed to have a bmi of approximately 32 hence he ha his work cut out for him 2 obesity a above 3 diabetes 4 possible coronary artery disease he apparently did fine on

possibility of her trying to gradually lose weight she currently weighs 199 lb and stand approximately 49 tall a far a longterm prognosis my current plan is to evaluate her blood pressure on another subsequent visit in the next 68 week and at that time if it is elevated we will consider either going up on her nifedipine xl dose or going up on her furosemide medicine seeing if we can possibly gain some better control or possibly adding another agent however at this point she seems to be doing much better with this new blood pressure and this is significant improvement maintenance from her previous blood pressure on her first admission which wa systolic blood pressure in the 200s190s her family situation which wa somewhat unstable at her first presentation now appears to be much more

from the time of her most recent admission i quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide which i feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her symptom over the next few day the final issue with the patient today is low back pain which she ha had chronically for the last several year after suffering a fall in 2065 we have tried a whole host of conservative measure which have included bed rest nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent and back exercise the patient is referred now to the paoli memorial hospital spinal clinic for service to obtain further help and

apparently he ha remained disease free since this time until a psa wa checked this past october which wa 353 he state that he had not had his psa checked for a few year before this admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointment the urologist at the bnh have since checked a bone scan and abdominal ct scan all of which were negative he ha the report here with him the bone scan doe show an abnormality at l5 but with data from plain film this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion he also ha had recurrent problem with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis this occurs once every few month or so and is not currently bothering him he state that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the bnh next week however is unsure if he ha had a urine cytology done impression in

punctate calcification in the left kidney without evidence for hydroureteralnephrosis likely vascular though renal calculus is possible assessment mr eubanks is a 68 yearold man with htn dm ii and gout who present with 2 hour of severe chest pain the differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia myocardial infarction aortic dissection pneumothorax pulmonary embolus bronchitis pleurisy gerdesophageal spasm musculoskeletalchest wall pain and anxiety the sudden onset of severe chest pain awaking him from sleep raise the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such a mi aortic dissection or pe the patient ha elevated ddimer but otherwise lack physical exam finding dyspnea pleuritic chest pain cough hemoptysis tachypnea sign of dvt or ctcta imaging feature consistent with pulmonary embolism the patient s htn is a risk factor for aortic dissection but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative cxr and cta scan which have 80 95 sensitivity in addition he lack a number of other clinical manifestation of dissection including syncope pulse deficit and new murmur the distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin aspirin moreover the patient ha had two similar but le severe attack a few day ago and ha multiple cardiac risk factor this make unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis ekg change lacked st segment elevation although twave inversion were present in some lead the patient s cardiac enzyme were negative from the ed x 2 set with a third troponin negative on the floor the patient may have either a nonst elevation mi or unstable angina the plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and ekg change with the next step likely to involve stress test

similar discomfort one or two minute later this is relieved by sitting it will happen when walking a well this is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he get in his foot due to the diabetic neuropathy he ha had no back trauma although he ha a torn right acl in the knee which lead to occasional fall of note he wear his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist past medical history the past medical history is a above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf allergy sulfa contrast medium ambien

spine wa performed at carolina medical centermercy and then again several day later at regional medical center bayonet point 8607210108 report and film reviewed from carolina medical centermercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the view are suboptimal the summary report from bayonet point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and i await faxed copy of that report assessment 1 neuropathy the patient ha likely multifactorial reason for his lumbar spine pain he did undergo an evaluation by dr ulysses harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which wa not effective at relieving his discomfort he likely ha a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy there is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy i think at this point an emg with nerve conduction study will be most helpful to identify the relevant contribution of these different factor i have also suggested that he invest in suspender and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief he ha tried a course of non steroidals without effect and i think i would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline a a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the neurontin that he is on for other indication i will see him back in the office after the emg ha been performed and i have had a chance to review the mr imaging thank you for sending him to my office it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and i am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree the risk and benefit of any recommended or alternative treatment were discussed diagnostic codelevel c5peripheral neuropathy

pressure and obesity recently he underwent evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography the echocardiogram revealed reduced left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent there wa no evidence of ischemia he subsequently underwent coronary catheterization i do not have those result but he claim that he wa told that he had no arterial blockage symptomatically he is significantly short of breath with minimal exertion he ha attributed this to his weight he wa started on an ace inhibitor and diuretic although he ha not been taking either of these medication prior to his catheterization a chest xray revealed a 15 cm nodule in the left upper lobe of the lung that wa not present in 2067 this wa confirmed subsequently on ct scan suggesting that this wa most likely a primary lung malignancy he is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with you his past medical history is remarkable for diabetes

exam regular rate and rhythm pmi nondisplaced normal heart sound no murmur or rub abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or cva tenderness no clubbing cyanosis or edema pulse full impression mr narvaez ha evidence of decreased left ventricular function by echocardiogram by report he ha no evidence of coronary artery disease although i have not seen this report myself if indeed it is true that he ha no coronary artery disease then my guess is that this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse in any case this put them at increased risk for an operation although probably le so than if he had significant coronary disease i see no reason why you should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately prior to his operation he should be placed on ace inhibitor and diuretic ill be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care to south side hospital sincerely yours

chief transplant divistion department of surgery family practice missoula re peggy tinsley fpm 23667033 dear dr stafford i wa asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on mr tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed a a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant in summary she is a 46 year old woman who ha been an insulin dependent diabetic since the age of 29 and ha been on hemodialysis since 2083 by report her other complication for diabetes include retinopathy peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease in viewing her present history she work in the houghton mifflin harcourt learning technology department her three time a week hemodialysis are uncomplicated she doe however experience occasional chest pressure with activity and on rare occasion ha had nocturnal angina these episode are relieved by nitroglycerin mr tinsley ha also noted that with walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved by slowing down in addition to diabetes and hypertension which wa present only predialysis she ha been and continues to be a smoker her cholesterol by one report wa 228 mgdl i dont have fractionation and her family history is unknown a report of an echocardiogram from april of 2083 show mild ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency preserved lv size and function she had an exercise tolerance test in february of 2085 on a modified protocol she went for le than 4 12 minute this is equivalent to not even completing stage 1 of the standard bruce with that she did develop chest pain and had 2 mm of st depression that study wa accompanied by both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion change in the septum consistent with prior nontransmural infarct with exercise induced ischemia a wa apparent to those involved even the nonisotope portion alone wa worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization that study wa done in macdonald hospital and at this time i only have the report however from this report there wa preserved lv function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace mr that is consistent with the echo and the thallium study coronary angiography showed by report diffuse involvement of proximal midlad without specific focal stenosis until an 80 mid lad the circumflex wa also diffusely diseased and there wa a discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal the right coronary artery wa diffusely diseased with a discrete stenosis at that time the recommendation wa to continue medical therapy her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with prempro 25 mg once a day tenormin 25 mg qd aspirin one every other day in addition to her supplemental vitamin iron and twice daily insulin therapy in rounding out her medical history her surgical procedure have involved the hemodialysis access she ha had one pregnancy 28 year ago without complication i also elicited a history of some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech this wa difficult to pin down but is of some concern on exam her blood pressure wa 15080 mm hg pulse 90 regular her weight 95 lb her hemodialysis shunt is on the left arm there wa a right carotid bruit neck vein were not distended lung were clear pmi wa displaced and sustained there wa an s4 no s3 and there wa a holo systolic murmur at the apex abdomen wa benign femoral pulse were intact extremity were without edema the electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm diffuse stt change there were no pathologic q wave although the focus of this evaluation wa originally for transplant candidacy i am concerned about her current cardiac status she is a young diabetic woman symptomatic of both shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test ha limited functional capacity the coronary angiography reveals a presence of multivessel disease even without seeing the primary data which i hope to do in the next week it would be unlikely that she would be an angioplasty candidate given the poor result in diabetic therefore coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery bypass surgery obviously i would like to review the film first and speak with dr upson regarding augmentation of her antianginals i would also like to add pravastatin at this time starting with only 10 mg and obtain noninvasive study of the carotids a indicated although the focus of this evaluation wa her suitability for transplantation the issue of controlling symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more pressing

nature of her disease and the increased risk due to her body habitus i discussed several option in renal replacement therapy with m vincent although she ha no medical condition which would preclude livingrelated or cadaveric kidney transplantation her obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of hidradenitis make transplantation a le attractive option i have encouraged m vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or transplantation nevertheless her appearance is quite reminiscent of cushing disease and this should be

contact with the renal fellow who recommended that we proceed dialysis while the dialysis unit still open and we felt that it wa safe for this patient his potassium wa not back at the time that he left the department however he wa well appearing and had no arrhythmia on the monitor and we think that his tickling chest sensation is very atypical for cardiac symptom not being so we will reassess when he come back and likely check a second troponin to be sure that this is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome after he left the department additional lab came back include inr of 21 and a chem7

and promptly called the renal fellow who wa aware of the elevated potassium and have the patient on the monitor in the dialysis unit and agreed to treat him there acutely again after the dialysis the patient will return to the emergency department we will reassess if symptom and see how he feel check a second cardiac enzyme if he feel significantly improved and he continues to have no chest pain we feel that his symptom are likely atypical for acute coronary syndrome and we also called that this wa not acute coronary syndrome if two troponins are not elevated and he will be able to follow up

regarding a biopsy proven adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas he apparently developed some twinge type pain in his right upper quadrant which he describes a zinger 6 or 7 week ago workup then involved imaging with a ct scan which i reviewed but do not have the written report on this show a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein he ha not had any jaundice and doe not have any change in his bowel function a subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with feature of portal vein invasion fine needle aspiration ha confirmed adenocarcinoma the mass itself is about 2 cm in diameter his family history doe not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer he denies smoking drinking but exercise by walking about 5 day a week his past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2131 cholecystectomy in 2131 prostatectomy for cancer in 2142 and resection of a lung cancer in 2143 his current medication include lipitor 40mg a day glyburide 5mg three time a day he ha been taking it for 6 7 year lisinopril 5mg a day and a baby aspirin he is said to be allergic to sudafed and the dye used for cat scan the latter wa apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a cat scan it is unclear whether the two are related his review of system also includes kidney stone and spinal stenosis he ha had some mild recent weight loss he denies symptom of heart disease neurologic disease or respiratory disease his review of system is otherwise unremarkable i think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time with the finding consistent with portal vein invasion he should first be treated with chemoradiation he may be a candidate for

dr short today i had the delight of seeing your patient mr craft for the possibility of central nervous system vasculitis a you know he is a 64 year old righthanded man with an extensive past medical history for a rheumatological disease his past medical history briefly is that he wa diagnosed with lupus in 2103 and at that time he had a butterfly rash he complained of chronic fatigue and he also had what wa considered temporal lobe seizure which were characterized a complex partial type event and elevated double stranded dna of 180 and ana of 1512 with a homogenous pattern all of these suggested that the patient did have lupus he wa treated for approximately three year with prednisone and he note that after medication were added by dr taliyah hoffman his symptom and seizure went away since that time he ha had a recurrence of symptom which includes fullness of his face and neck pressure within his head he considers himself to have vascular headache with facial weakness ringing in his ear numbness and tingling of his left hand and arm excessive salivation and increased appetite in describing his headache he noted that it is primarily a headache which is there every day and ha a combination of throbbing sensation a well a throbbing quality it is worse in the frontal temporal area and is not associated with nausea vomiting or paraesthesia there is no family history of migraine a well also during his headache event he doe not notice any decrease in his appetite or any nausea or vomiting past medical history a per above medicval issue include bipolar ii with ____________ diagnosed in 2110 hypothalamic gonadism hypothalamic hypothyroidism and questionable history of migraine headache his current medication include lamictal risperdal testolactone chromisene levoxyl altace for hypertension ibuprofen prn and prednisone prn he is allergic to penicillin lozol bee sting and allopurinol there is a questionable history to aricept which he feel that the use of this medication made his current symptom come out of remission brice short md recraft lloyd mrn26649180 31614 page 2 family history is remarkable for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in father and father also had heart disease social history he is a former stage manager neurological exam he wa awake alert oriented x 3 attention wa normal speech wa fluent without dysarthria or paraphasic error

righthanded male with a history of lupus in the past his recent blood work show that his doublestranded dna wa negative taking into consideration his current constellation of symptom and his mri report that i evaluated which were completely normal except for small vascular disease at this time he doe not fit with the diagnosis of central nervous system vasculitis he wa told that he is at a high risk for having a stroke secondary to 1 having high blood pressure and 2 having an elevated cholesterol if it is possible to maintain his blood pressure in good control and start a cholesterollowering agent he is to discus this with you and also consider starting aspirin 81mg po qd for primary prevention of heart disease he wa informed that it is possible that there is some element of his immune system fluctuation and possibly his hormonal therapy may be contributing to some of his symptomatology but the diagnosis or etiology of these symptom is not clear thank you for
